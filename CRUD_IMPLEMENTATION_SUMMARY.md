## Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- All endpoints require JWT authentication (except login)
- Three permission levels implemented:
  - **Public**: All authenticated users
  - **Admin**: Admin and Super Admin users
  - **Super Admin**: Super Admin users only

### Permission Matrix
| Operation | Permission Level |
|-----------|-----------------|
| GET (Read) | Public |
| POST (Create) | Admin |
| PUT (Update) | Admin |
| DELETE | Super Admin |

## Key Features Implemented

- Range validation (coordinates, stock values)
- Unique constraint validation
- Foreign key validation

### 2. Relationship Management
- Proper handling of model associations
- Cascade delete prevention with dependency checks
- Related data inclusion in responses

### 3. Search & Filtering
